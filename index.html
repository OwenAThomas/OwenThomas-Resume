        <p class="lead mb-4">	My name is Owen Thomas, I am an 18 year old student at the University of California, Riverside that goes by he and or him pronouns. I am currently enrolled as a pre-business major and live in a learning community with fellow pre-business major students. My projected graduation year is 2026 where I intend to have a Masterâ€™s degree in Accounting and hope to become a certified public accountant by the end of 2027. I attended Mira Costa High School located in Manhattan Beach from 2018 to 2022. Within my time there I was involved in the band program for all four years of my high school life. The music department had many goals for their students including, reaching their fullest intellectual potential, having an outlet for artistic expression, developing a lifelong appreciation for music, and experiencing an improved quality of life. Having spent so much time with the band program, whether it be through the marching band, jazz band, or concert band, I was always surrounded by people who I cared about and who cared about me. Together, we achieved many of the goals set by the band program, and had a great time all the while. While I attended Mira Costa High School, I was a part of the schoolâ€™s Badminton team for 3 years. During my freshman year, I was on the junior varsity team. I spoke with everyone on the team and became good friends with them all, that combined with my prior experience of 5 years playing the sport allowed me to win the Most Valuable Player trophy for that year. During my time playing high school badminton, I was flexed into all three types of ways the sport can be played a male: Menâ€™s Singles, Menâ€™s Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. Depending on whatever the team needed at the time, I would take whatever role was needed, and because of this I was able to learn how different each style of the game was. I learned the dynamics between teammates and how to support them better, as well as learning how to support myself and play selfishly at times. I started Tae Kwon Do when I was around six or seven years old. My parents wanted me to be able to defend myself in case any misfortune came my way, so I began my self defense journey at a young age. At first, I didnâ€™t see any reason as to why I should be taking the class at all. I hated each and every second of it, but as I spent more time and started to climb up the ranks, I felt a desire to see it through. The elusive black belt was something I would end up dedicating 3 years of my life to. I was also one of the founders of my school's Presentation Club. Presentation club aimed to provide fun topics and prompts to keep students engaged while learning how to use Presentation softwares such as Google Slides and Powerpoint. This served as a way to help students develop their public speaking skills and prepared them for future job endeavors.
